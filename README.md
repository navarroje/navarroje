### Project Manager & Game Designer | Navigating Complexity, Delivering Worlds.

A versatile and results-driven project manager with over 6 years of experience connecting disparate stars of experienceâ€”from the tangible world of industrial design to the complex systems of agile game production.

My mission is to navigate the chaos of creation. I use a human-first philosophy as my North Star, ensuring that every decision serves the team I lead and the users we create for. By charting clear roadmaps and leveraging innovative workflows, I turn ambitious visions into successfully delivered realities.

## The Constellation: A Catalog of Missions

My career has been a journey through diverse systems and creative challenges. Each role represents a key star in my professional constellation.

### â˜… Reconnaissance & Systems Analysis (2024 â€“ Present)
#### **Freelance Consultant | Project Management & Product Design**

Post-mission, I engaged in deep-space reconnaissance of the F2P casual games market and took on independent contracts to sharpen my skills.

*   **Performance Marketing Study:** Analyzed modern **User Acquisition (UA)** funnels and key metrics (CPI, LTV, ROAS) that drive profitable growth.
*   **Physical & Digital PM:** Managed small-scale ventures, including a residential renovation project (budgeting, sourcing, contractors) and an e-commerce setup.

### â˜… Mission Command (2021 â€“ 2024)
#### **Game Producer & Associate Producer | KILLSOFT**

As a key member of the command crew at a remote-first studio, I demonstrated clear progression and was trusted with high-stakes missions.

*   **Lead Producer (2023-2024):** Led production for a proprietary PC game, commanding a crew of up to 20 across all departments. Owned project schedules, defined milestones, and managed all QA processes from analysis to execution.

### â˜… The Sabbatical (2019 â€“ 2021)
#### **Game Designer & World-Builder | Self-Directed Creative Projects**

I embarked on a deliberate creative sabbatical to pivot from industrial design to game development, focusing on independent creation and systems architecture.

*   **TTRPG System Design:** Architected a complete tabletop RPG system from the ground up, writing extensive documentation and creating a framework for future expansion.
*   **Information Architecture:** Acted as a "lore keeper," honing skills in knowledge management and building complex, interconnected databases using **Notion**.

### â˜… The Foundation (2016 â€“ 2019)
#### **Industrial Designer & Production Lead | Digiprint**

My career began by building tangible worlds, establishing a strong foundation in client-facing project management, manufacturing processes, and design software.

*   **Production Lead (2017-2019):** Managed diverse industrial design projects from initial client brief to final delivery, overseeing budgets, quality control, and cross-functional team coordination.
*   **Junior Designer (2016-2017):** Contributed to the design of Point-of-Purchase (POP) displays and experiential event structures, gaining proficiency in **Photoshop, Illustrator, SketchUp, and SolidWorks**.
