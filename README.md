## A Human-First Approach to Navigating Complexity

With over 6 years of experience spanning the tangible world of **industrial design** and the complex systems of **agile game production**, I don't just manage projects; I bring them to life. My philosophy is built on a human-first approach, whether I'm designing a physical product, leading a remote development team, or creating a system to support a loved one.

My expertise lies in turning ambitious creative challenges into streamlined, actionable plans. I believe the best products are born from clear communication, efficient systems, and a deep understanding of the people who will use them.

## I. Professional Case Studies: From Concept to Delivery

Here is a selection of projects demonstrating my capabilities in full-cycle project management.

### Case Study 1: Game Production for a Global Streaming Leader
*   **Project:** NDA Mobile Title commissioned by **Netflix**
*   **Role:** Game Producer (KILLSOFT)
*   **The Challenge:** To lead a cross-functional team of 20+ artists, programmers, and designers through the entire development cycle, ensuring all contractual milestones were met on time and to the client's exacting standards.
*   **My Process & Contribution:** As the central hub for the project, I owned the production schedule, managed sprints using Agile methodologies, and facilitated all communication between departments. A key focus was proactive bottleneck resolution—identifying potential roadblocks in the art or engineering pipelines weeks in advance and reallocating resources to maintain momentum.
*   **Artifacts of Production:**
    *   **Project Roadmap:** *[Placeholder for a clean, visual graphic of the project timeline from pre-production to delivery]*
    *   **Kanban Workflow:** *[Placeholder for a professional-looking screenshot of a sample Trello/Jira board showing the sprint workflow]*

### Case Study 2: Holistic System Design (The Ancestral Kitchen)
*   **Project:** A comprehensive nutritional system to support a family member's health.
*   **Role:** Systems Designer & Project Manager
*   **The Challenge:** To design and implement a complete nutritional framework based on traditional techniques and natural, anti-inflammatory foods. This was a high-stakes project with the most important stakeholder imaginable.
*   **My Process & Contribution:** This project required a blend of deep research, supply chain management (sourcing organic ingredients from local producers), process optimization (iterative recipe development), and constant stakeholder feedback. I created a sustainable, day-to-day operational plan that was both effective and manageable.
*   **The Outcome:** The successful implementation of this system played a key role in supporting my mother's health and well-being during a critical time, demonstrating that solid project management principles can create profound human impact.

## II. Creative Concepts & Independent Design

A showcase of my passion for design and my workflow for turning ideas into reality.

### Conceptual Industrial Design
*   **Objective:** To continuously explore new product ideas using modern, AI-driven workflows to rapidly move from concept to photorealistic visualization.
*   **Showcase:**
    *   **Project 1: The AURA Smart Air Purifier:** *[Placeholder for the "One-Pager" image for this project]*
    *   **Project 2: Modular Home Office System:** *[Placeholder for the "One-Pager" image for this project]*
    *   **Project 3: Ergonomic Gaming Peripheral:** *[Placeholder for the "One-Pager" image for this project]*

## III. Shippable Products & Independent Studio Work

In 2019, I embarked on a creative sabbatical to fully pivot into the world of game design. This led to the creation of **Navarro Game Studio**, my independent label for TTRPGs and campaign management tools.

### Navarro Game Studio
*   **My Brand:** The public-facing creative imprint for my horror games is **"El Camino de Hierro,"** focusing on themes of "Hidden Horror" and "Beautiful Decay." This is expressed through a signature UI concept I developed called **"The Butterfly Trap."**
*   **My Work:** I am a one-person studio, handling all aspects of production from system design and world-building to writing, layout, and digital publication.
*   **Explore My Published Works:** I invite you to explore my projects on Itch.io, where you can find rulebooks, guides, and Notion templates designed for game masters and players.

## IV. The Project Manager's Toolkit (Skills Gallery)

I believe that organization is a form of art. A well-designed system empowers a team to do their best work. Here are examples of the project management artifacts I build.

*   **Notion Dashboards:** *[Placeholder for a clean screenshot of a beautifully organized Notion dashboard for project management]*
*   **Trello Boards for Agile Sprints:** *[Placeholder for a screenshot of a well-structured Trello board]*
*   **Project Documentation:** *[Placeholder for a screenshot of a well-formatted page from a Game Design Document (GDD) or similar]*

## Let's Build Something Remarkable

I am always open to discussing new opportunities, freelance projects, or just talking about good design. If you have a project that could benefit from a human-first, systems-oriented approach, I'd love to hear from you.
